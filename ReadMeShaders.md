Only relevant scene for shader programming is OverworldTestZone, which displays some vector math and mesh and texture generation.

Enemy uses vector magnitude to check if the player is withing seeing distance and then arccos and dot product to determine if the angle between the player and enemy is less than the max vision angle, functions for the maths it uses are in the VectorMath script.

Wall mesh generated based off the scale of the original object by the WallGenerator script, which uses the MeshBuilder script from one of the handouts, though I did myself add a function to rotate all vertices in the mesh.

SpriteEditor script can add a grayscale filter or outline to inventory sprites. 
The original sprites are generated by a script that generates a thumbnail image of a mesh, this script was NOT made by me. 

The shader in the Scripts/ShaderRelated folder does not do anything yet.
