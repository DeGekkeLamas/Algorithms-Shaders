    /// services with a dictionary with the types of the services as keys. The pattern is very
    /// straightforward: the service locator is a proxy between the service user and the services so
    /// that the service users don't directly call the services, so that your application and the
    /// implementation of the services are decoupled.
    /// This pattern is globally accecible, and, like the name indicates, is suitable
    /// to implement global services in your game, e.g. micro-transaction shop, achievement system,
    /// save load system, etc.
    /// This pattern is not suitable for modules like HUD manager, enemy manager, etc because they are
    /// not global modules.
